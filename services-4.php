									> Appraisal Review</a></h4>
						</div>
						<div id="collapse4" class="collapse">
							<div class="panel-body">
								<p class="text-justify">As per new mortgage rules, the onus of procuring an unbiased estimate of a home, rests squarely with the mortgage lender. This makes it imperative for them to embrace an objective way to assess the home’s value. However, acquiring a good appraisal report is fraught with challenges. Lenders’ assessment is as good as an appraiser’s assessment, and if the appraiser goes wrong so does the lender. Sometimes, the process can get too tardy. It may take weeks to get an appraiser to visit a property, and the appraiser may take weeks to conclude. Availing the mortgage underwriting services by a leading provider is thus crucial for precise appraisal review. Outsourced mortgage underwriting professionals have detailed understanding of the appraisal process. They actively communicate with the appraiser to ensure the appraisal process is correct.
								<p>Our mortgage appraisal review process is well-defined, and we use the most current version of the appraisal report form applicable for the specific type of property. We order appraisals on behalf of the lender to certified appraisers. Thereafter, we stay in touch with them till we get the appraised value of the property in the shortest possible time. We also assist the lender in reviewing the report to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. We review appraisal photographs, location maps, property sales history, appropriateness of the comparable, adjustments, as well as the report date, appraiser's signature and license number, before passing on the report to the lender. The mortgage contract underwriting services by aExpert Mortgage Assistance is thus versatile.</p>
								<p>With our streamlined services we ensure lenders get their appraisal work done in short turnaround and with greater accuracy.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Verify license and certification of appraiser</li>
									<li>Review current market and comparable properties</li>
									<li>Review inspections done as per investor guidelines</li>

								<p class="text-justify">Mortgage lenders often fall prey to fraudsters. Frauds can range from stretched borrowers misleading a lender to secure a loan, to organised criminal rings involving corrupt brokers to rob a lender. Though lenders go all out to insulate their business from fraud, the desire to grow their business is so pressing that they unwittingly walk into fraud traps. Investing in an outsourced mortgage underwriting service can thus be beneficial to lenders and credit unions in the long run. Experienced mortgage underwriting companies house fraud experts who have an instinctive understanding of spotting fraudulent applications.
								<p>We specialize in identifying possibly fraudulent items such as AVM comps mismatching with the appraisal, conflicting addresses, large deposits or withdrawals, multiple cash transactions in several bank accounts, and more such grey areas that suggest potentially fraudulent activities.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Verifying borrower residential addresses</li>
									<li>Verifying contractual agreements for relevance</li>
									<li>Verifying 3rd party docs</li>
									<li>Verifying bank statements and credit reports</li>
									<li>Carrying out phone re-verification</li>
								</ul>
								Our mortgage underwriting support services are based on basic underwriting controls. For instance, we validate and re-validate data entered into an automated underwriting system (AUS); and have proper checks and sign-offs to ensure greater accuracy. Complex underwriting requirements go through multiple stages of quality checks and are signed off by seniors having 10 years of experience in underwriting. Our experience in mortgage contract underwriting services also helped us develop an instinctive understanding of the risk components of mortgage loan processing. This understanding helps us ask the right questions to your borrowers, identify contentious issues, and spot inconsistencies with ease. We also rely on a detailed and well documented process to gather information to support the value of questionable appraisal. All these together have helped us carve a niche as a mortgage loan underwriting company. Thus, outsourcing mortgage underwriting can add value to your overall lending process.
