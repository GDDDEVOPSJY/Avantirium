                <h1> WE THINK AND WORK FOR YOU </h1>
                <h2> Design, Procure & Build</h2>
                <p>Our Design Team is a young experienced and enthusiastic professional team of architects who have worked on large and medium sized projects. The work comprises of Commercial, Industrial, Residential and Hospitality projects. We work from the concept stage of visualising the client requirement and suitably detailing it. We categorise our architectural and designing scope for the complete structure to the most minute detail for your interiors. We are well versed with the Building rules as notified by the state governments.Procurement plays the most important aspect of designing a project, cost & budget and timely availability onsite. We source material from various countries depending on the project needs. Products from Indian states are vastly used and recommended in our projects. We directly work with the manufacturers to obtain best competitive rates. Usually our projects have custom built solutions and hence an eye-for-detailing and procurement is a must. We at Primo Consulting & Contracting are enthusiastic in creating specialised buildings and structures that are distinct in design in complex and specific architecture.</p>
