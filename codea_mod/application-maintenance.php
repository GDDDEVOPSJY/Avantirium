                    	The third-party application maintenance usually consists of a ticketing service through which acute problems are addressed on a case to case basis. Companies always keep a close watch on the latest releases, Technologies and trends to avoid missing out on new features which may be crucial to their business.

                    <p>
                    	In today&acute;s dynamic business environment, business houses have to be more agile and need to thoroughly rethink their approach to application maintenance. For example, most of the Cloud service providers are pushing to the client&acute;s updates on new versions of their software thus resulting in a decreased level of control on the part of companies relying on their software. This, in turn, generates a need for partners who can anticipate these changes and provide actionable insights.

                    	Codea keeps a watch on the version releases and proactively suggests our client&acute;s certain courses of action when new software releases are anticipated, this helps our clients not only avoid negative impacts but also help them stay ahead.
