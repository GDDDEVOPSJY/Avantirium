                        SAP S/4HANA migration is the move from an SAP ERP system, such as SAP ECC or SAP R3 that runs on premise on a database other than HANA, to SAPâ€™s next-generation S/4HANA business suite which could be either on-premise, hosted in the cloud or hybrid.

                    <p>
                        Now is the time to make the move to SAP S/4HANA. It will allow you to migrate step by step and reap the benefits before your competitors do.
