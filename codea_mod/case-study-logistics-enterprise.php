                    <p>
                    	WGA Logistics is a disruptive leader in the global logistics and transportation industry with its headquarters in Doha and the business of Freight and Logistics...
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">THE SITUATION</h4>
                    <p>
                    	<b>WGA Logistics needs a technology partner to support its digital strategy</b>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	The company follows the ‘asset-light’ business model and is highly committed to innovation in their strategy. They recognise technology and innovation as its key differentiators and growth enablers. Continually investing in bespoke digital solutions, WGA found it challenging to staff their fast-paced projects locally. Moreover, the innovative and user-centric nature of these projects required vast expertise in data science, UX design, business analysis and R&amp;D.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	In late 2015, WGA decided to look for a technology partner  to support their entire order and delivery process. They needed a technology peer who could proactively contribute to design and ideation, rather than just provide development services under close supervision. The client chose Codea for our best cost/value balance, extensive expertise in mobile UX, data science and R&amp;D, as well as for our innovation culture.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">THE SOLUTION</h4>
                    <p>
                    	<b>Parallel delivery of a  consumer-facing and operational Mobile App and Web App</b>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	The client named the mobile App Turud – Turud is an on-demand logistics app which aggregates the price offered by different service providers. Customers need to enter the origin and destination of the parcel along with the parcel dimensions to get the list of service providers with Price aggregation and comparison of the services offered.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	Clients can compare the delivery time, reviews and ratings of different providers which includes Fedex, Aramex, UPS, DHL and Bluedart etc. Once the service provider is selected they can move to payment and complete the order. Customers can track the status of the order and rate the service.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	The range of services provided by Codea covers full-cycle product development and includes business analysis, product design, software architecture, data science, software development, quality assurance and implementation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	Codea successfully adapted to the business environment of WGA and engaged effectively with the operations team. The team was scaled as required for the project within short turnaround time.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	In order to get the whole pipeline of projects off the ground and set up the development process, the Codea team conducted several types of research and user interviews during four onsite discoveries at the WGA office in Doha. WGA highly appreciated that Codea acted as a technology consultant, contributing ideas and challenging requirements, rather than following the regular outsourcing model. This approach perfectly aligns with the innovative and fast-paced way of doing business at WGA logistics.
