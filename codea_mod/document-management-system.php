                            IoT devices tend to be small in form-factor that is limited RAM, disk space, low power requirement etc. This makes it important to pay great attention to resource requirement and consumption. And due to the fact, that IoT is all about scaled and smart devices deployed, we need to focus on the scalability and security of these devices.

                        <li>
                        	We have worked with many companies that started pilot IoT projects and quickly realized that the architecture they had created would not scale to support their application. So the key is planning for the quantity of data which will be created. Building an IoT platform on high performance, massively scalable and highly reliable platform from the start can help to avoid scalability and performance challenges that arise with production scale deployments.

You need reliability at scale, not just in the lab. Has to ensure that performance doesn’t fail and your infrastructure could be globally scaled so that users could be added further away from your points of presence.</li>
                        <li><b>Security:</b> IoT devices are expensive and added to that the failure or security vulnerabilities could have a real-life impact on the people around them. You need to ensure that you’re protecting your deployment itself as well as the data flowing through it. While forming a security strategy important considerations should end to end encryption, secure firmware, access management and open-port management.</li>
                        <li><b>Low-latency:</b> Speed is an important factor. One has to make sure they use low latency protocols and technologies to provide the real-time speed necessary to control and monitor IoT devices. Every millisecond counts when it comes to devices.</li>

                    	<li>Adoption of IoT technologies has become a much-needed factor for organizations to stay ahead of their competitors and to effectively meet the demands of their customers. Organizations, therefore, need to advance their ability to adopt these technologies while minimizing the unacceptable risk. An ideal solution for organizations will be deploying IoT assets as modular pieces and by adopting a network approach of introducing them incrementally, visibly and intentionally to the current system. The assets could be exposed as APIs, which can be configured on a zero-trust model, creating layered defences that prevent the API from trusting new entrants prematurely. <br>While organizations continue to add new technologies at a faster stride, this approach is very much vital to allow them to minimize and mitigate the associated risks at the same time.</li>
                        <li>The past two years have seen a burst of platforms like Amazon and Google Home has become more universal. There is an increasing demand for integration. Ecosystems are still in the early stages for the consumer towards a fully autonomous smart home.</li>
