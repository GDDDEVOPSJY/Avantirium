                    	Keeping a proactively healthy cloud environment is never an easy task. In fact, it is an on-going battle against outages, security threats, broken systems, and random acts of IT failures. Organizations need to make cloud monitoring a priority and plan for tools and platforms that offer visibility to security, performance, and reliability.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Utilization of manual or automation techniques to monitor the performance of applications, servers etc.</li>
                        <li>Assessment and evaluation of resource utilization, server response times, availability and operating speeds to ensure possible issues are addressed well in advance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                        Cloud monitoring can perform the following capabilities:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitoring cloud data across distributed locations</li>
                        <li>Eliminating potential breaches by providing visibility into files, applications, and users</li>
                        <li>Continually monitoring the cloud to ensure real-time file scans</li>
                        <li>Regular auditing and reporting to ensure security standards</li>
                        <li>Merging monitoring tools with different cloud providers</li>

                    <p>
                        While many organizations choose cloud monitoring to support and manage public clouds like AWS or Azure, there are different cloud services that may also benefit from monitoring. And while the following services could be monitored through application monitoring tools and services, cloud monitoring provides deeper insights and protection. 
                    </p>

                        Below is a list of cloud services to include in a cloud monitoring checklist:
