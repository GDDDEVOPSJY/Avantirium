                                Predictive analytics solution refines the raw data related to vehicle fleets and converts it into insightful information. This helps companies to easily identify vehicles or its components that require maintenance and take alternative measures to manage fleet operations without interruption.  Another advantage of this analysis is companies can save huge costs by performing expensive post-damage repair works.

                                The wide range of factors that affect logistical efficiency have a direct impact on end-product pricing. Any variation in those factors can cause deviations in overall freight costs and impact the final product price. Shipping cost pricing should be flexibly set based on actual shipping costs .Predictive analytics solutions are capable of factoring in cost-impacting components to provide competitive pricing that is optimised. The price prediction is based on both internal data analysis and external factors such as weather conditions and delivery timings. Thus ensures dynamicity in pricing logistics operations proportional to real-time cost data in balance with competition.
