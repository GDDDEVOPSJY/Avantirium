                        Container Freight Station is the place where containers are stuffed, de-stuffed and aggregation and segregation of export and import cargo happens. Codea FR8 software has been designed to assist both end users and management with day to day tracking of containers. The  volume of international trade has been growing in a fast pace in the last few decades, and this in turn has resulted in the need for expeditious clearance of goods at the port within the minimum possible time. Most of the busy  ports across the globe are facing congestion at their premises. Codea FR8 consolidates this data together for them to report to Customs of the receipt and unpack information. This delivers measurable time saving results.

                        Codea FR8 Container Freight Station system enables ports and people to optimally utilize the existing infrastructure, space, equipment and manage Cargo and container movements within the allocated premises. . From the moment the import container arrives to your Container Depot, FR8  allows multiple staff to unpack a single container.

                        The module extensively covers the operational, financial and communication aspects of the CFS. One of the key functionality of FR8 – CFS module is that it provides  Status based Management of inventory at each operational level, once it is received in the port, and until it arrives to the distribution centre. CFS module  helps you manage the containers in the station’s yard, optimizing movement tasks based on various operational and business factors. Also gives you a Complete Audit trail on every container in the station and throughout the chain to allow importers information for improving their importing costs
