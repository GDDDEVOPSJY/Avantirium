                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">The cloud migration process</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                    	Your exact roadmap for migrating to the cloud depends on the size and complexity of your environment. These are the basic steps:
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b style="color:black;">Planning your migration:</b> Before you start its important to define  clearly  your reasons for the move and which strategy can best support them. After assessing your current environment , move ahead to  calculate your cloud server requirements based on current application resource requirements .Getting expertise of a specialist at this stage will help you to  avoid buying more than you need. An application performance management solution can provide complete, real-time visibility into your environment and all its dependencies while rolling up strategy as part of the package.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b style="color:black;">Choosing your cloud environment:</b> Now the step ahead is to decide what kind of cloud model you want to adopt. Whether you choose public cloud, hybrid cloud, private cloud, or multicloud (or services like Google, Azure, or AWS).This  depends on which best serves your current and future needs. You should make sure that  your Application Performance Management solution (APM) extends to your chosen provider.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b style="color:black;">Migrating your apps and data:</b> Perfect panning ensures a smooth journey ahead. cloud security concerns are still to be watched carefully, such as complying with security policies and planning for data backup and recovery. Using APM to baseline pre migration performance has to ensured in preparation for the next step.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b style="color:black;">Validating post-move success:</b> You cannot declare a cloud migration successful without evidence that it works as expected. By Choosing the perfect solution, you can prove the benefits of cloud migration by comparing pre- and post-move application performance, from both a technical and business perspective, in a low-risk test environment.
