                        Information regarding each employee of the company can be saved in the employee master, which can
                        be updated without removing the existing / previous data. Employees can be assigned to a particular
                        location, transferred or suspended.

                        categories.
                        Employees can also login to the ERP and request a leave, which can be processed through an approval
                        flow. This approval queue can be defined based on the employee’s location / department. At any point
                        of time, an employee’s leave history and balances can be viewed using reports.
