                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	The  platform combines and presents data of  different transport modes like trains, buses, cars, and flights in one search and thus helps  users find the fastest, cheapest, and most comfortable travel options to any city, town, or village in Europe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	Currently, our client&acute;s platform operates in European countries, serving thousands of rail and bus stations and hundreds of airports in its service areas and its coverage are growing. This has already helped travellers from more than a dozen countries plan their journeys across Europe with ease using a tool that brings together Europe’s excellent rail, bus, and air travel infrastructure.

                    <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Challenges – Client &amp; Codea faced</h4>
                    <p>
                    	The client decided to use the new funding they received to fuel a significant expansion into new markets. Equipped with long-tested and effective. With sufficient infrastructure and other resources, Client was ready to spread their travel services to Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Nordic countries. To make this strategic step, however, they needed to scale their cloud-based platform to cover new travel destinations and give access to local travel service providers who have partnered with them.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	The client has a multicultural work environment, and they decided to engage with a software partner to whom they could delegate responsibility for the technical side of their scalable platform to support the expansion into Central Europe and Nordic countries. The strategic partnership with Codea has helped them expand their international team which consists of specialists from different countries and achieve greater coverage to the best travel tool.
                    </p>

                    	Codea engineers have been working alongside our client&acute;s team on a backend solution to increase the number of convenient transportation connections.

                    <p>
                    	The platform connects with countries to which they have newly partnered with various modes of transport so that travellers can search and book optimized multi-mode journeys which include Air, Rail and other Public transport systems.
