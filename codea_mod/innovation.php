                        SIE Lab creates an open, collaborative platform based on a unique partnership between Codea, our leading enterprise customers, and promising start-ups globally. While legacy enterprises have traditionally been slow to innovate, start-ups are fast and lissome but lack scale and distribution. Codea recognizes this void within the ecosystem and bridges this gap by bringing trust, deep understanding, and distribution, thereby serving as the conduit of change for tomorrow.
