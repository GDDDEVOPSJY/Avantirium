                    <p>
                    	Imagine an application that doesn’t run on one server but harnesses the excess power of thousands of computers globally and that can be controlled by business automation software that ensures if a specific parameter is met, only then can a function be carried out.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers instead of a single computer, and are outside the purview and control of a single authority.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The purpose of DApps is to help app users safeguard their personal information throughout the transaction process. Another purpose of DApps is to reward users for generating content on social media platforms.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Decentralized apps or Dapps don’t need a mediator to function or manage our information. It connects users and providers directly. So nobody else can penetrate our data.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The frontend of a decentralized application represents what you see, and the backend represents the entire business logic. This business logic is represented by one or several smart contracts interacting with the underlying blockchain. The frontend, as well as files like a photo, a video, or audio, could be hosted on decentralized storage networks such as Swarm or IPFS. Traditional Web applications use HTML, javascript and CSS or the like to render a webpage. This page interacts with a centralized database, where all the data is stored. When you use a service like Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, or Airbnb, for example, the webpage will call an API to process your personal data and other necessary information stored on their servers, to display them on the page. User ID and passwords are used for identification and authentication, with low levels of security, since personalized data is stored on the server of the service provider.

                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Will DAPPs Transform The Mobile App Development Industry?</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                    	DApp proponents tend to believe that everything a conventional mobile application can do, a decentralized application can do better. DApps have already made inroads into various industries like the healthcare, education, real estate and the legal field and it will soon have a great impact on the entire economy that surrounds the mobile development.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Changes are getting visible in the existing mobile business models so as to become more customer centric and respect the user privacy.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        To be more precise, let’s have a look at some of their core benefits. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <div style="border:solid 1px #cccccc; padding:10px; margin-bottom:5px;">
                        <b style="color:black;">Increased Security</b><br>
                        The overall nature of decentralized applications provides for greater levels of security, in general. Because the DApp is supported by a distributed ledger, a potential attack would have to successfully target the majority of it. In a lot of cases, attacking the network is more expensive than protecting it, hence why the security is naturally elevated.
                    </div>
                    
                    <div style="border:solid 1px #cccccc; padding:10px; margin-bottom:5px;">
                        <b style="color:black;">Unprecedented Transparency</b><br>
                        Transactions that take place on the blockchain, as well as any information logs, are easily verifiable. If it’s a public ledger, everyone can take a look. If it’s a private ledger, everyone within the organization can.
                    </div>
                    
                    <div style="border:solid 1px #cccccc; padding:10px; margin-bottom:5px;">
                        <b style="color:black;">Superior Involvement of Community</b><br>
                        As we mentioned above, DApps tend to be open-sourced. Moreover, depending on the consensus algorithm of the network, users can take part in the governance of the DApp and it’s in the community’s best interest to participate and produce actively.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Game Changing DApps</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        There are already many Dapps in finance, trading, healthcare, media, and games. In 2021 Dapps will enter all other arenas as well. In short, the revolution of blockchain application development is right around the corner and will be among the latest trends in mobile apps.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Depending on the blockchain platform, dApps are also used by small and large businesses to track and trace goods as they move around the globe and enable cross-border financial transactions without the need of a middleman such as a central bank or clearing house.
                    </p>

                        This dApp and consultancy is striving to solve problems with Supplier Information Management systems, which today are slow, inefficient and unable to adapt to new requirements quickly. Chainyard, a permissioned blockchain-based network, is designed to improve supplier validation, onboarding and life cycle information management.

                        A web browser with almost 9 million active users, Brave is attempting to turn the online advertising model upside down by putting consumers in the driver's seat. The app creates a new measure of value in the advertising world where “consumer attention” is used to set value more than unverifiable views or clicks on a webpage, Gartner said in its Cool Vendors in Blockchain Applications report.
