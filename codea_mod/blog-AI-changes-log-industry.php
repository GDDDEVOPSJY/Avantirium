                    	The application of <a href="https://www.codeatechnologies.com/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" style="color:red;">artificial intelligence</a> has enabled a radical change in the work system of the Freight and Logistics industry. Thanks to AI, companies have moved from a reactive scheme, in which logistics operations were adapted to changes in demand, to another proactive one, in which managers anticipate demands and adapt their resources accordingly. This has resulted in an improvement in efficiency and an increase in profitability.

                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">More Accurate Shipment Tracking</h2>
                    <p>
                        AI help companies to predict accurately, how long shipping will take and assist to spot trends and risks in shipping lanes and ports. Using this data will help to determine variations in shipping time. Machine Learning technology can also help analyze historical shipping patterns by taking into consideration the weather patterns and busy or slow shipping seasons. Automating the processes could also help to predict problems before they happen. The company can then make adjustments to get their products to the customer on schedule. Furthermore, AI can assist with optimizing the shipping route by analyzing data, addressing potential problems before they happen.

                    	Artificial Intelligence in combination with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) provides the workers with an opportunity to increase their quality of work. AI and RPA (Robotic Process Automation) allow employees to speed up the working processes by automating the everyday repetitive tasks. For example, there are some data-related tasks that repeat every day like entering the data in Master bills and House bills. This could be effectively automated using Cognitive automation, a technology evolved from a  combination of AI and RPA . This lowers costs ,Saves time and improves the accuracy and timeliness of data for logistics companies.

                    <p>
                        <b>Scheduling and tracking:</b> AI systems can schedule the transportation, organize pipelines for cargo, assign and manage various employees to particular stations, and track packages in the warehouse.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b>Invoice/bill of lading/rate sheet processing:</b> These documents help communication between the buyers, suppliers and logistics service providers. Document automation technologies can be used to increase the efficiency of processing these documents by automating data input, error reconciliation and document processing.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b>Report generation:</b> Logistics companies can use RPA tools to auto-generate regular reports that are required to inform managers and ensure everyone in the company is aligned. RPA solutions can easily auto-generate reports, analyze their contents and based on the contents, email them to relevant stakeholders.
                    </p>
