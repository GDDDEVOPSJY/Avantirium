                    <p>
                    	LOGOS is a smart enterprise solution that enables maintenance teams to incorporate real-time data into their workflows. The product has two modules which are LOGOS Map2Assets and  Map2Mobile. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	Map2Assets allows maintenance teams to leverage the data generated by the PLC/SCADA sensors. This enables them to monitor the health of assets by analysing a number of indicators such as cycle counts, runtime hours, fuel consumption, temperature, and pressure readings.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	Condition data generated by Map2Assets can also be sent directly to the technicians with Map2Mobile. This solution combines alarms from SCADA systems with EAM/CMMS data, including work orders, asset history and spare parts and sends it to techniciansâ€™ smart devices, reducing unplanned downtime by as much as 65 Percent.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	Using LOGOS Map2, maintenance teams have mobile access to the CMMS or EAM system. The solution enables seamless workflows to be completed on mobile devices, giving maintenance teams the time needed to respond to fault notifications while on the go. The module allows enterprises to plan and coordinate asset maintenance more effectively, reduce unscheduled downtime, and improve response times to problems or system failures.
