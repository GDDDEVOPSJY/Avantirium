                    	Codea is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce. There is a growing recognition of how critical diversity and inclusion is to business performance. At Codea Technologies we understand that everyone is unique and the diverse background that they come from adds to the plethora of point of views and experiences that our employees bring to the table. We believe in the ideology of embracing difference and ensure that we respect and treat all with dignity. This has led Codea to become an equal opportunity employer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	While we understand and are aware that all aspects of diversity needs must be given equal importance, at Codea we have picked 2 focus areas on which a gamut of initiatives have been planned and executed in the past and are lined up for the future. These focus areas are Gender &amp; Disability.
