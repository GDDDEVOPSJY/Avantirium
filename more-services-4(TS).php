                <p class="text-justify">When your title search process is done correctly, you as a lender, get accurate insights into the history of the homeowners, such as who bought the property, who sold the property, and when these transactions were carried out. The report provided by the title company is not always error-free and so it falls upon the lender to examine the report properly to unearth errors. When you outsource mortgage title services to us, you need not be worried about this aspect of your service to your customers.</p>
                <p>After acquiring the report, we conduct a thorough inspection of all the financial obligations associated with the property proposed to be acquired. This includes legal claims, lawsuits, taxes, judgments, and liens, as well as any other issues that could impact the property transaction. During the examination process we conduct a quality review to ensure the right sequence of file numbers, presence of all pages, and quality of all images. It is at this point that we verify the legal description of the property and assess the completeness of records.</p>
                <p>The one thing we are very mindful of while reviewing a title policy are the exceptions i.e. instances in which coverage cannot be offered, unless certain actions are fulfilled, such as paying the required taxes, removing a lien, resolving boundary issues, or clarifying ownership. We also identify any issues there might be such as inaccurate or contradictory information. This spares you the trouble of diverting your attention from your core business, while ensuring you don’t end up being on the wrong side of the law.
                </p><br>
                <p>Some Standard Exclusions for Title Commitments We Have Handled Over the Years Include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Boundary issues i.e. matters related to encroachment</li>
                  <li>Rights of tenants with continuing lease terms</li>
                  <li>Construction/workers’ compensation liens</li>
                  <li>Issues not registered in public records (easements)</li>
                </ul><br />
                <p>When reviewing title commitment exceptions, we review exceptions carefully and meticulously so that you can arrange any documents or take any actions necessary to remedy the problem in a timely manner and avoid closing delays. In complex cases, we draw your attention to issues that cannot be remedied by the seller.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Review title reports and examine the chain of title to ensure no illegal deeds exist</li>
                  <li>Clear any disputes and defects attached to a property</li>
                  <li>Analyze records, such as mortgages, liens, judgments, easements, vital statistics, and plat and map books, to determine ownership and legal restrictions</li>
                  <li>Verify legal description of property and completeness of records</li>
                  <li>Identify issues such as missing information, inaccurate information, or contradictory information contained in the title documentation</li>
